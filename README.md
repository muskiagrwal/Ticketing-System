Go to **schema_query_backup** folder and copy all the query and run into supabase sql editor, that's all.

And deploy this on vercel.com with setting up env variables from .env.local.example

## Roadmap

I'm going to keep building this software every weekend and will keep you updated via GitHub notification email(if you watching this repo).
